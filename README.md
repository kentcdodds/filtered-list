#filtered-list

A simple app where you can give it data from a csv, check things off, and export it as a csv.

##How to use

###1. Import data

Get a CSV file and open it in any text editor. Copy all of that text and past it into the Import Data text box. Press the "Import" button.

You will then see the headings for the content you imported, select the radio button that corresponds with the column you want to see in the search filter below.

###2. Search through data

Simply type and click or hit <kbd>enter</kbd> to add data to the export list. The search filter will search based on any data for a given row in the data you exported. For example, if you're data has names and phone numbers, you could display the names and search with the phone numbers. Clicking <kbd>enter</kbd> will cause the item at the top of the list to be added to the export list.

###3. Export Data

Once you've moved everything from the search column to the export column you can remove items with the similar search functionality and then click the "Export" button. This will place all of the data that has been added to the export list in a csv format in the export text field. Copy that and save it to a file and you'll have your data!

##Other stuff

###Real-time online

The data is synchronized in real time with our secure servers. So you can have multiple people editing the data simultaneously.

###Password

DON'T forget the password you set in the first place. It's the ONLY way you can access your data...

###More features

We're still in beta. But this should work pretty well...
